# Installation Instructions
1. Download the Circuitpython `.uf2` for the Hack Club Sprig from [here](https://circuitpython.org/board/hack_club_sprig/). Follow the instructions to install the binary onto the Pico.
2. Put `code.py` and `suitsbmp/` into the drive labelled CIRCUITPY. The board should now refresh with the new code,  and the game should be displayed onscreen. Optionally, use Thonny or the Circuitpython extension for Visual Studio Code to run the code from the serial monitor/REPL.

# gambling
Use the D button to Hit (draw). Use the J button to stand. When the round ends, you can press the K button to play again. Restarting the Sprig will reset the win counter.

# Licensing
No clue why you'd want to use this, but do with the code as you wish.
